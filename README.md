The “Sorting Visualiser” project is basically a web development project which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms and performs the operation of algorithms step by step as the algorithms works
like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort , Merge Sort etc. We shuffle the bars in a random order that is in a unsorted order. 
We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in a ascending order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms .

Technologies used :

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT

   6 different types of sorting algorithms is used to visualise :
Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort
